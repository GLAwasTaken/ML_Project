## Project Summary

#### Used Technologies: *Python*, *Pandas*, *SciPy*, *seaborn*, *scikit-learn*

This is the project for the **Machine Learning** exam.
The task is **Classification** on the Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention dataset of the CMS (Center for Medicare and Madicaid Services), which contains various clinical data regarding CMS patients. \
The purpose of this project is to train and evaluate different Machine Learning models in order to understand which one works the best for our task. \
The project is structured in the following sections:
- **Data Understending**, we analyse the dataset to have a better understanding of the data we are working with (e.g. number of total records and null values, correlated and redundant attributes, attributes types)
- **Data Preparation**, we modify the dataset to have the best possible performance on the models (e.g. type casting, removal or substitution of null values, removal of correlated attributes)
- **Modeling**, we split the dataset, train the models and evaluate them with the same metrics (to choose the best model)
- **Evaluation**, we compute plots and matrixes for the overall evaluation of the best model

## Project Structure
The main notebook is [Heart_disease_complete.ipynb](https://github.com/GLAwasTaken/ML_Project/blob/main/Heart_disease_complete.ipynb), everything is explained there.
The other three notebooks ([Heart_disease.ipynb](https://github.com/GLAwasTaken/ML_Project/blob/main/Heart_disease.ipynb), [Heart_disease_mean.ipynb](https://github.com/GLAwasTaken/ML_Project/blob/main/Heart_disease_mean.ipynb) and [Heart_disease_outlier.ipynb](https://github.com/GLAwasTaken/ML_Project/blob/main/Heart_disease_outlier.ipynb)) are variations of the main one. \
